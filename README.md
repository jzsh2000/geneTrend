geneTrend
=========

In this project, I'm trying to answer the following questions:

* Which gene is the hottest in the last year?
* How does the degree of a gene's hotness change over time?
* Who contributes most to a gene's function discovery?

The origin data are fetched using NCBI's [Entrez Direct][edirect] toolkit. Data
analysis will be performed on the [R][R] programming environment.
